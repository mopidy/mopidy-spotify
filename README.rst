`Mopidy <https://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for playing music from
`Spotify <https://www.spotify.com/>`_.


Status
======

Mopidy-Spotify is dependent on ``pyspotify``, a wrapper for Spotify's
``libspotify`` C library. ``libspotify`` was `deprecated in 2015
<https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/110>`_ with no replacement. It
is unmaintained, functionally limited, and also now unavailable from the
`Spotify developer site <https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/>`_. Where
possible we are `moving to use Spotify's Web API instead
<https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/114>`_. However, native
playback is still only possible using ``libspotify`` and there is no official
way for us to provide some Spotify features.

Limitations and/or bugs in ``libspotify`` currently result in missing/broken
Mopidy-Spotify support for the following:

- My Music (`#16 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/16>`_,
  `#108 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/108>`_) - available via
  web API

- Podcasts (`#201 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/201>`_) -
  unavailable

- Radio (`#9 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/9>`_) - unavailable

- Spotify Connect (`#14 <https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/issues/14>`_) -
  unavailable

Working support for the following features is currently available:

- Playback

- Search

- Playlists

- Top lists

- Lookup by URI


Dependencies
============

- A Spotify Premium subscription. Mopidy-Spotify **will not** work with Spotify
  Free, just Spotify Premium.

- A non-Facebook Spotify username and password. If you created your account
  through Facebook you'll need to create a "device password" to be able to use
  Mopidy-Spotify. Go to http://www.spotify.com/account/set-device-password/,
  login with your Facebook account, and follow the instructions. However,
  sometimes that process can fail for users with Facebook logins, in which case
  you can create an app-specific password on Facebook by going to facebook.com >
  Settings > Security > App passwords > Generate app passwords, and generate one
  to use with Mopidy-Spotify.

- ``libspotify`` >= 12, < 13. The official C library from our `Unofficial
  libspotify archive <https://mopidy.github.io/libspotify-archive/>`_.
  The package is available as ``libspotify12`` from
  `apt.mopidy.com <http://apt.mopidy.com/>`__.

- ``pyspotify`` >= 2.0.5. The ``libspotify`` Python wrapper. The package is
  available as ``python-spotify`` from apt.mopidy.com or ``pyspotify`` on PyPI.
  See https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/ for how to install
  it and its dependencies on most platforms.

- ``Mopidy`` >= 2.0. The music server that Mopidy-Spotify extends.

If you install Mopidy-Spotify from apt.mopidy.com, AUR, or Homebrew, these
dependencies are installed automatically.

Configuration
=============

Before starting Mopidy, you must add your Spotify Premium username and password
to your Mopidy configuration file and also visit 
https://www.mopidy.com/authenticate/#spotify to authorize this extension against
your Spotify account::
